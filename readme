This is a perl module to integrate with AOL's TOC protocol for instant
messaging. I found this a while ago on www.foo.org/~james/, which appears to
have gone awol. As far as I know, there isn't anywhere else to get it, so
I'm cleaning it up for CPAN and including it here. 

The original author is james@foo.org, and his README file is included as
README.old
