This is a Perl5 interface to the AOL Instant Messenger "TOC" service. Enclosed
you should find the appropriate modules (put them in your PERLLIB somewhere)
and a couple example scripts, including a simple "bot."

I'm not big on writing documentation, so it's assumed that if you're playing
with this that you dig perl, and don't mind reading the code :-)
